The **Simple Calculator** in C++ performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users input two numbers and select an operation. It validates input, prevents division by zero, and allows repeated calculations or exit.

The **Simple Calculator** in C++ is a user-friendly program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program allows users to input two numbers and select an operation from a menu.

The program starts by displaying a clear menu of options:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Exit  

The user inputs their choice, and the program validates it to ensure itâ€™s a valid option. For invalid inputs, the program prompts the user to try again, preventing crashes or unexpected behavior.

After selecting an operation, the program asks the user to input two numbers. It performs the chosen operation and displays the result. For division, the program checks if the second number is zero and prevents division by zero, displaying an error message instead.

The program runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations without restarting. Users can exit the program by selecting the "Exit" option from the menu.

With features like input validation, error handling, and a clean menu-based interface, this calculator is an excellent project for beginners to learn loops, conditional statements, and user input handling in C++. It combines practicality with interactive learning.
